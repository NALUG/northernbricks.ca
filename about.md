<b>NORTHERN BRICKS</b> is brought to you by <a href='http://nalug.ca'>NALUG – Northern Alberta LEGO® Users Group</a>.

NALUG has brought the love of LEGO<sup>®</sup> to Edmonton and area since our formation in 1999.

<b>NORTHERN BRICKS</b> held smaller shows in 2015 and 2016.

This year, 2024, we decided to go <b>BIG!</b> We’ve invited LEGO® Masters to share the LEGO<sup>®</sup> joy with everyone.

A couple of hundred <i>fantabulous</i> MOCs (My Own Creations) will be on display.

LEGO<sup>®</sup> vendors will be on hand, showcasing their unique wares.

A huge play brick area for children of all ages will be available.
