Northern Bricks 2015 took place May 28 - 31, 2015.

Well the craziness is over, the frantic hours of setup and teardown are passed, the crowds of people were more than pleased and all in all we had a blast! All of the members of NALUG pulled together to bring about the first lego convention in Western Canada full of games, crazy creations and much more. Throughout the weekend, we had the opportunity to participate and help run many activities such as blind builds, speed builds and purely creative ones. A big shoutout to Eric Mcallum who took the time to cooridnate all of the games and activities as well as bring down some huge Lego statues - they were awesome! We also had the chance to welcome a few members of SLUG (Saskatchewan Lego Users Group) who were all great guys to hang out with and had some serious lego skills to boot. As for displays, ther ewas everything from castle, to trains to space and steampunk and mosaics that were impressive all around. Check out the pictures below!
