Northern Bricks 2016 took place June 3 - 5, 2016.

Northern bricks was a blast this year with a full four days of LEGO goodness. From parts drafts, to competitions and the everstressful period of setup, we had a great time participating this year and bringing about an even larger layout than last time. From trains to sci-fi, technic or castle the show had something for everyone. It also featured a number of new, impressive creations including a massive A6 Juggernaut from starwars and an incredible Minecraft display. A huge thank you to everyone who came out to admire the displays and participate in the EEk! comic and pop culture fest along with Northern Bricks.
